                         <p>Our edge is we continually push for better answers to these questions than are generally available to either professional or retail investors. We insist answers be logical, computable, and true to the nature of markets. With good answers in hand, we are able to create algorithmic strategies which allocate money across asset classes in very effective and timely ways, and also fundamental strategies which are able to select individual securities for purchase when the risk/reward equation is most favorable over the long term.

                <p>Here is what you need to know about our edge.</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>We have put a great portion of our efforts into devising robust methods to evaluate the risks of computerized strategies. When we test a computerized strategy, we construct and measure its overall performance across many possible implementations rather than cherry picking the best possible implementation. When deciding on a specific implementation, we reduce the odds of curve fitting by evaluating many fewer possible implementations than the number of transactions involved (often less than 10% of transactions).</li>
                    <li>Almost all quantitative approaches to market investing adapt statistical methods devised for casino games. We believe markets are different from casinos in several very important respects: different games have correlated outcomes, each play is not independent of previous plays (i.e., the games have memory), the underlying odds of a win or loss are fuzzy and unknown rather than precise and known, and those odds change over time. We design our strategies and techniques around these beliefs.</li>
                    <li>Inventing new math is hard, so almost all professional investors and academics consider casino statistics good enough. We use measurement and decision techniques, including several we have invented for purpose, designed to treat markets as natural phenomena in their own right rather than force fitting them into the mold of casinos. Having better measures provides better results.</li>
                    <li>Our strategies are likely to remain effective over the long run because they are self-updating. Drawing on machine learning principles, our models and methods use reasoning to continually re-evaluate the evidence in the markets and change themselves to reflect new evidence.</li>
