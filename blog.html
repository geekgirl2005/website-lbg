        Not long ago my wife and I attended one of those prospecting dinners wealth management firms frequently organize at the better local restaurants. If you live in certain zip codes, reach a certain age and live a lifestyle which gets you into certain marketing databases, you know the type I’m referring to. These firms mail nicely printed invitations offering a free dinner at a fancy local restaurant and, in exchange for top notch food, all you have to do is listen to a presentation about someone’s wealth management services while you eat. It’s the upper middle class/lower upper class version of a timeshare presentation.
        </p>
        <p>This one was sponsored by a group claiming to be the largest independent firm of its type in the mid-Atlantic area. Their pitch was as follows. The firm used a database of price information across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities) covering the last 40 years to search through 55,000 possible ways of weighting the assets, rebalancing annually or semi-annually, to find the very best combination of target allocations and timing for rebalancing. Based on the results of this search, they selected three strategies to match different client’s risk versus return needs. Wouldn’t you know it, all three of these strategies meaningfully outperformed a “stocks only” portfolio over the time period. Also, they generously offer services to “centralize all of your wealth” so you do not have to deal with multiple institutions during retirement.
</p>
        <p>
            After the presentation, I overheard several other attendees remark about how good it was, using words like “powerful” and “intelligent”. I felt sorry for them. Here is what they did not know but should have been told: The selection method which found the strategy almost certainly produces junk. Forty years of semi-annual rebalancing between four classes of assets involves at most 320 transactions (a buy and a sell of an ETF indexing the asset class). Any effort to validly optimize the strategy is constrained by this number. Unfortunately, the odds of ending up with an entirely invalid, “curve-fitted” solution - that is, one whose results are based on a lucky throw of the dice rather than discovery of an enduring principle - increases rapidly with the number of options searched through. 
        </p>
        <p>
            How big can the search be? A good rule of thumb is that any search in which the computer looks at more alternatives than there are transactions is essentially guaranteed to be invalid, i.e., curve fitted. In this case, the 55,000 alternative ways to set target allocations which the group evaluated are so much greater than the 320 transactions involved in rebalancing, that this particular “solution” was very unreliable. In my opinion, this firm was looking for suckers. By putting the 55,000 number out there, they counted on being able to impress people with the effort they put into finding the very best solution, assuming the difficulty most people have evaluating numbers and probability would mask the truth, which is that this large number undermined rather than strengthened their case.

        </p>
        <p>
            Another big problem with what I heard is that, though “looking at 55,000 possible strategies covering forty years and four asset classes” sounds superficially impressive, in the age of computers it is a trivial analysis. A hacker at any bank or investment firm could put together a program to do the same analysis in half of a day, and once coded it could be run to completion in minutes. This firm did not uncover any kind of “secret” which all other professional money managers, with trillions of dollars under management, do not also know. Even if by some miracle, this firm’s strategy was more than curve fitted, everyone else in finance knew about it also and, by chasing it, they would collectively guarantee it will underperform in the future.

        </p>
        <p>
            I know this is harsh but...the people at that dinner with me who were impressed by this approach were suckers. Don’t be a sucker.

        </p>
        <p>
            There are two kinds of wealth managers you can trust (and these guys above were not either kind). The first will tell you to diversify using index funds across various asset classes, recommending a vanilla allocation strategy, and will charge you for various professional services related to tax planning, estate planning, budgeting, etc. You should be able to decide for yourself how much these services are worth to you, and you will be under no illusions that you are paying for investment performance.

        
        </p>
        <p>
            The second kind will try to deliver increased odds of beating a vanilla strategy and will be able to explain to you the “edge” which tilts the odds in your favor. Also, they will be clear there are two interpretations of what it means to “beat” a vanilla strategy. Interpretation one is to increase total returns. Interpretation two is to decrease the ups and downs (called “volatility”) you experience. Any firm in this category will be honest with you that they can deliver one or the other of these paths but delivering on both in any meaningful way is very unlikely. If you want to end up with more money after a long period of time, you are going to experience more ups and downs along the way. If you want a smooth ride to your end goal, you will likely have less money at the end.

        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, they will emphasize everything - and I mean, everything - regarding these strategies is about probability and statistics. There are no guarantees. Any firm’s edge will be about tilting probabilities in your favor, and hoping that over a long enough period of time you will benefit from better odds. That is all anyone can do.

        
        </p>
        <p>
            Evaluating whether someone has an edge is difficult, especially because no one can fully disclose their edge without losing it (because of copycats). Here are some guidelines,
        </p>
            <ol class="ol1">
            <li class="li1">Ask how many strategies they looked at and how many experiments to validate it they performed. Do not look just at what the performance was of the strategy they are selling. In the world of probability, if you look at enough things you are bound to find a good one by chance. This is &ldquo;curve fitting&rdquo; and you should avoid firms which do this. Strategies discovered via large searches for the &ldquo;best&rdquo; will do much worse in the future than they did in the past.</li>
            <li class="li1">If a strategy works, there should be a comprehensible general principle to it. Even though the firm cannot share details, they should be able to share a compelling logic.</li>
            <li class="li1">Ask what is difficult about executing on the strategy, i.e., why isn&rsquo;t everyone doing it? If it does not involve some kind of difficulty which has been overcome, and which others in the field will acknowledge is difficult, it is not likely to be real. </li>
            <li class="li1">Ask why the strategy is likely to be effective over the long run. What are the assumptions behind it? Why will those assumptions remain true? And why won&rsquo;t everyone else start doing the same kinds of things tomorrow?</li>
            </ol>
